CAPSTONE PROPOSAL

1.
- React JS (frontend)
- Node Express (backend)

2.
- The backend is going to be my primary focus, with intentions to have a completely functional front end.

3.
- Website

4.
- The goal will be to allow users to acces player and team data and manipulate it with provided options.
	ex: get averages, compare teams/players

5. 
- Sports fans

6.
- Plan on using real and up to date sports data provided by an API on the web

7. 
a) see attached for draft of database schema
b) The API being used for my CapStone contains many layers of data, and I will only be using specific data
	still being determined. A potential issue could be only getting the necessary data without the 
	unecessary data.
c) Would need to secure login credentials for users and also the API key.
d) app will include login/signUp functionality, will be able to get data, manipulate the way data is showed, 
	search for data by keyword(s). Allow usser to add team to favorites list
e) USER FLOW
	- Login
	- Navigate to teams page or players page
	- select options for stats to show
	- add/remove teams or players to favorites
	- update profile info on profile page
	- logout
f) Added chart manipulation for past data (stats)
   combine algorithms to show comparisons between teams
   all user to save options created and favorite teams
